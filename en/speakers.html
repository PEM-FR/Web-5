                In this session I will talk about dgrid, the new open source project living in the Dojo Foundation.<br/>
                We will cover why we  decided to write it, why you should use it, how it works, and how to work with it. We will cover performance gains, how it is easier to work with than other grids that shall not be named, use-cases, its plug-ins and more in this talk about the best grid to hit Dojo yet.<br/><br/>
				<h3 class="noStyle topic">eventd - simulated synthetic events</h3><br/>
                Make unit testing cool again (was it ever?) with eventd, a new tool written in JavaScript to be used with the DOH unit testing framework. eventd uses synthetic events to keep all your unit test writing in JavaScript as well as having more browser support than doh.robot.<br/>
				See how to use eventd with doh in this presentation, and how it can make your unit tests more complete and reusable.

				<h3 class="noStyle topic">Scaling Isomorphic Javascript Applications</h3><br/>
                A piece of code is said to be "isomorphic" if it can run both on the client and the server. Node.js has emerged as the most popular server-side Javascript implementation and presents both opportunities and challenges to developers who wish to take advantage of the economy of scale in productivity and API surface area isomorphic Javascript offers.<br/>
				This talk will discuss isomorphic Javascript as well as how the Flatiron "anti-framework" (http://flatironjs.org) addresses the challenges and capitalizes on the opportunities.<br/><br/>
